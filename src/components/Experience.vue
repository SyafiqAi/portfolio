                Digital Systems Malaysia - Worked in a team of 7 developers, contributing to the 
                development of a customer-facing website using an <strong>agile development</strong> 
                method through <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>.
                I gained hands-on experience in front-end development using 
                <strong>Vue</strong> and version control with <strong>Git</strong>.

                Although I was familiar with <strong>HTML</strong>,
                <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JS</strong> fundamentals, Vue was a new 
                technology for me, but I took the time to read the documentation, experiment with
                Vue's features and seek guidance from the experienced developers in my team. I was 
                able to grasp quickly the concepts and contribute to the team.
